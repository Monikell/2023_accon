    This dataset contains measurements of morphological (leaf, stem,
    root, and seed), nutrient, and isotopic traits for plant species
    growing in the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Approximately 104
    species were sampled in or near four core sites of the SEV-LTER
    (core_blue, core_black, core_creosote, and core_PJ) plus the
    Sevilleta Field Station between 2017 and 2021. In addition, seed
    masses were measured from a 2016-era seed collection provided by
    Jenny Noble and added to the dataset; for these, site = NA.

        core_black - Five Points Black Grama is a core monitoring site established in 1999 at the transition between Chihuahuan Desert shrubland and Chihuahuan Desert Grassland ecosystems. The Five Points Black Grama site is ecotonal, bordering Chihuahuan Desert shrubland at its southern extent and Great Plains Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary. Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda).

        core_creosote - The creosote core site was established in 1999 in an area dominated by creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), with sparse herbaceous cover. The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Shrubland, dominated by a creosote overstory, with broom snakeweed, purple prickly pear (Opuntia macrocentra), and soapweed yucca as co-occurring shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous, dense, grass-dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama Site. Common grasses are black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bushmuhly (Muhlenbergia porteri), and galleta grass (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forbs include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.).

        core_PJ - The Cerro Montosa pinon-juniper site has been the location of major Sevilleta LTER research since 1989. The vegetation is New Mexico pinon-juniper Woodland, dominated by Colorado pinon (Pinus edulis) and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), and accompanied by gray oak (Quercus grisea). There is a diverse shrub component, including scrub live oak (Q. turbinella), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), sacahuista (Nolina microcarpa), red barberry (Mahonia haematocarpa), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), skunkbush (Rhus trilobata), and banana yucca (Yucca baccata). Grass diversity is also high, and open spaces between trees are dominated by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), with hairy and sideoats grama (B. hirsuta and B. curtipendula) and black grama (B. eriopoda) also abundant. Other common grasses include purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea), wolftail (Lycurus phleoides), mountain and ring muhly (Muhlenbergia montanus and M. torreyi), and New Mexican porcupinegrass (Heterostipa neomexicana). Common forbs include small-flowered milkvetch (Astragalus nuttallianus), white sagebrush (Artemesia ludoviciana), Fendler's arabis (Arabis fendleri), Fendler's sandmat (Chamaesyce fendleri), New Mexico thistle (Cirsium neomexicanum), false pennyroyal (Hedeoma oblongifolia), bastard sage (Eriogonum wrightii), pingue rubberweed (Hymenoxys richardsonii), large four o'clock (Mirabilis multiflora), Fendler's penstemon (Penstemon fendleri), and globemallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

    Study Site -
  
          
    All sampling was conducted within The Sevilleta National Wildlife
    Refuge (SNWR) in central New Mexico. We focused on plant species
    inhabiting blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis)-dominated shortgrass
    steppe (Great Plains grassland), black grama (Bouteloua
    eriopoda)-dominated Chihuahuan Desert grassland, creosote bush
    (Larrea tridentata)-dominated Chihuahuan Desert shrubland, and pinon
    (Pinus edulis)- and juniper (Juniperus monosperma)-dominated forest
    in the mountainous, higher-elevation regions.
  
          
    Plant Tissue Collections -
  
          
    Leaf, stem, taproot, seed, and isotope measurements were often made
    on the same set of plants (N range 1 to 10 per species) collected
    from the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. The main collection
    time was between September and October 2017, but further sampling
    for missing species or traits continued through Spring 2021. When
    plant species were represented in multiple habitat types, we
    attempted to collect all samples from the habitat type in which they
    were most common. In the case of grasses and forbs, we collected
    entire plants or clonal sections into Ziploc bags enclosing paper
    towels moistened with deionized water and transported them in a
    refrigerated cooler to the University of New Mexico main campus in
    Albuquerque. We separately collected taproot, stem, leaf, and seed
    samples from different parts of larger shrubs, preserving and
    transporting them as above. When in laboratory, samples were kept at
    20C for up to one week prior to processing for trait measurements.
    Fine-root samples were taken on haphazardly sampled plants in
    November 2017 using the same collection methods as above, but care
    was taken to collect entire root systems intact. Because not all
    plants sampled for leaf, stem, and root tissue were fruiting at the
    time of collection, additional seed collections were made between
    October 2017 and June 2018 to supplement the initial collection; in
    addition, a seed collection from the Sevilleta made by Jennifer
    Noble provided many missing species. Trait measurements as described
    below closely followed the plant trait handbook of
    Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. (2013).
  
          
    Leaf traits -
  
          
    We removed up to 5 leaves or leaflets per plant (excluding petioles)
    from haphazardly selected locations across each plant sample,
    supplementing with additional leaves (maximum of 20) when leaves
    were very small, and hydrated them for at least 24 hours (up to one
    week) in deionized water at 20C. We then imaged leaves on a Canon
    9000F Mark II flatbed scanner, with default settings (300 dpi, full
    color) with a single image per plant sample, dissecting curled
    leaves so as to image the entirety of leaf surface area. Immediately
    after scanning, leaves were patted dry and weighed (wet mass) as a
    group to a precision of 0.1mg (Mettler Toledo New Classic MF
    balance). Leaves were then dried to constant weight at 60C and
    reweighed (dry mass). Leaf dry matter content (ldmc) was calculated
    as dry mass divided by wet mass.
  
          
    We used ImageJ (Build 1.52a) to automatically measure the area of
    each leaf in the scanned images, checked the automation on each
    image, and measured the area of leaves with failed automation by
    hand. We calculated specific leaf area (sla) as the total leaf area
    imaged (sum of all leaves) divided by their dry mass.
  
          
    Foliar Elemental Isotope Composition -
  
          
    We assayed the foliage of up to 3 plant samples per species at the
    UNM Center for Stable Isotopes to determine the relative composition
    of carbon and nitrogen, as well as the composition of C13 and N15
    relative to C12 and N14, respectively. Foliage was dried to constant
    weight, powdered with a steel-bead tissuelyser (sample was put in
    two mL round bottom centrifuge tubes with two 3.2mm chrome steel
    ball bearings (BioSpec Products Cat. No. 11079132c), run on Qiagen
    Tissuelyser II at a frequency of 30 rep/sec, for two minutes). A
    target of 3mg of powdered tissue was sampled for analysis, measured
    on a microbalance.
  
          
    Stem and root traits -
  
          
    We excised ~1-to-3cm sections of the primary stem just above the
    soil interface and primary root just below the soil interface, and
    rehydrated them in deionized water at 20C for a minimum of 24 hours
    before taking volumetric and mass measurements. For plants lacking a
    clear primary stem (e.g., with radial stem arrangement), we randomly
    chose one secondary stem to sample. For plants without a primary
    root (e.g., grasses), we excised an upper section of a randomly
    chosen fibrous root. We estimated the volume of stem and root
    sections by measuring the diameter at the top and bottom of each
    section, as well as total length, with digital calipers (precision =
    0.1mm); we calculated volume using the formula for a truncated cone.
    We patted each section dry and weighed as above (wet mass), then
    dried to constant weight at 60C and reweighed (dry mass). We
    calculated root and stem density (rdens and sdens, respectively) as
    the dry mass divided by volume, and calculated root and stem dry
    matter content (rdmc and sdmc, respectively) as the dry mass divided
    by wet mass.
  
          
    To estimate root traits, we collected fine root systems from up to
    three plant samples per species. We excised fine root sections from
    the lowest level of branching order observed to allow for meaningful
    cross-species comparisons of specific root length. Sections were
    preserved in 50% EtOH for ~4 months, imaged on a flatbed scanner (as
    for leaves), then transferred to deionized water. After no less than
    24 hours, fine-root sections were patted dry and weighed on a
    microbalance, dried to constant weight at 60C, then reweighed (dry
    mass). Fine-root dry matter content (fr_dmc) was calculated as the
    dry mass divided by wet mass.
  
          
    We used the SmartRoot (v. 4.21) plugin to ImageJ (Build 1.52a)
    (Lobet et al. 2011) to measure the total length and average diameter
    of imaged fine roots, following the protocol outlined in the
    provided quick start user guide. Specific root length (srl) was
    calculated as fine-root dry mass divided by total root length. Root
    diameter was calculated as the arithmetic average of all imaged
    fine-root sections. Fine-root density (fr_dens) was calculated as
    dry mass divided by volume.
  
          
    Seed traits -
  
          
    We collected up to 20 seeds per plant sample on up to 5 individuals
    per species, choosing only fully developed, ostensibly viable seeds
    with hardened seed coats, and avoiding anomalously shriveled or
    flattened seeds. Groups of seeds were imaged with a Nikon D70 DSLR
    on a tripod, dried at 60C for 1 week, then weighed together on a
    microbalance. Seed mass (seed_mass) was calculated as the arithmetic
    average mass of seeds per sample.
  
          
    Life history characteristics -
  
          
    Life history characteristics of each species, including annuality
    vs. perenniality (LifeHistory), native vs. exotic status (Native),
    photosynthetic pathway (PhotoPath), and functional group
    (FunctionalGroup) were appended from the Sevilleta Long Term
    Ecological Research Program Plant Species List, publication date
    2019-09-30 (doi:10.6073/pasta/685df487cb89f424969904bcdf4f2926).
  
          
    Quality control -
  
          
    Data were checked via visual inspections of distributions, followed
    by double checking of data entry.
